# Mini-2D-rpg

This is a game created during my time doing a PLC course in Blackrock. We were required to create an outline of a game using the Unity engine. This was my first attempt at working with Unity and I decided to create a top down fantasy rpg game were the player used arrow keys to move the player arround. A simple AI that would move in random directions and if they collided with the players sword they would die on a one hit basis.
